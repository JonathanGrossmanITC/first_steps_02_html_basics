# HTML Basics  

Welcome to the second lesson! In this lesson, you continue learning about HTML. You learn about HTML's tag syntax by examining different tag types. By examining tag syntax, you will become familiar with which tags to use in which situation, how to fill tags with content, and how to use the inspector to assist you with writing HTML. You also learn about HTML attributes, which are properties of HTML tags that can help you define and control HTML elements. Finally, you can participate in a live coding session in which you will see how to start a project from scratch and add to it several different types of HTML tags.  

The live coding session is intented to reinforce what you learn earlier in the lesson and to help prepare you for making your personal portfolio site. The code from the session is included in this repository. You can use it however you like, but as with any code you get from someone else, make sure you understand it well enough to explain it to someone before putting it in your own projects.  

In this lesson, you learn:  

- Hour 1: [HMTL Tag Types](#html-tag-types)    
- Hour 2: [HTML Attributes](#html-attributes)   
- Hour 3: [HTML Live Coding](#html-live-coding)  

The topics below outline what you learn in the live session. After the live session, you can use this material as a resource for guided self-learning. This document will serve you as a roadmap for gaining repetition with the material that you learn during the live session.   

Also included in this material is the code from the live coding session.  

## [HMTL Tag Types](#html-tag-types)  
 - [Tag types](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/) for content  
 - Which content tags to use in which situation   
    -- [metadata](https://html.com/document/metadata/) tags  
    -- [`body`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_body.asp)  
    -- [`div`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.asp)    
    -- [`span`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_span.asp)    
    -- [`h1` - `h6`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hn.asp)    
    -- [`p`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_p.asp)    
    -- [`a`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp)    
    -- [`img`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp)  
  - HTML5 may help
    -- Modernized HTML tags designed for specific use cases  
    -- You may see [HTML5](https://html.com/document/) online or in other people's code  
    -- It's okay to use HTML5 or to not use them; regardless, try to be consistent and predictable with your code  
    -- Among many benefits, HTML5 may make your code [easier for you and other developers to read and maintain](https://html.com/html5/)
  - How to fill tags with content  
    -- Opening and closing tags  
    -- Self-closing tags  
    -- Nesting elements inside other elements
  - Tips on working with images
    -- [Web Images: Practical Tips Plus Code To Put Them To Best Use](https://html.com/images/)
    -- [Images in HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Images_in_HTML)
  - How to use the inspector to assist you with writing HTML  
    -- Can you move the inspector to the right side of your browser?  
    -- Can you move the inspector to the bottom of your browser?  
    -- Look at the Elements tab and find the HTML elements  
    -- Where in the Elements tab do you see HTML content?
    -- In the Elements tab, can you change the name of a tag?
    -- Do you see any built-in styles for each HTML element?
    -- How do you open HTML tags in the Elements tab so that you can see what's nested inside?
