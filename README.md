# HTML Basics  

Welcome to the second lesson! In this lesson, you continue learning about HTML. You learn about HTML's tag syntax by examining different tag types for holding content. By examining tag syntax, you will become familiar with which tags to use in which situation, how to fill tags with content, and how to use the inspector to assist you with writing HTML. You also learn about HTML attributes, which are properties of HTML tags that can help you define and control HTML elements. Finally, you can participate in a live coding session in which you will see how to start a project from scratch and add to it several different types of HTML tags.  

The live coding session is intented to reinforce what you learn earlier in the lesson and to help prepare you for making your personal portfolio site. The code from the session is included in this repository. You can use it however you like, but as with any code you get from someone else, make sure you understand it well enough to explain it to someone before putting it in your own projects.  

In this lesson, you learn:  

- Hour 1: [HMTL Tag Types](#html-tag-types)    
- Hour 2: [HTML Attributes](#html-attributes)   
- Hour 3: [HTML Live Coding](#html-live-coding)  

The topics below outline what you learn in the live session. After the live session, you can use this material as a resource for guided self-learning. This document will serve you as a roadmap for gaining repetition with the material that you learn during the live session.   

Also included in this material is the code from the live coding session.
